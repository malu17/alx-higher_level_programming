# 0x05 - Python - Exceptions

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
