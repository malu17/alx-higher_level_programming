### [2. Filter states by user input](./2-my_filter_states.py)
* Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.


### [3. SQL Injection...](./3-my_safe_filter_states.py)
* Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?


### [4. Cities by states](./4-cities_by_state.py)
* Write a script that lists all cities from the database alx_0e_0_addis

### [5. All cities by state](./5-filter_cities.py)
* Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database alx_0e_0_addis


### [6. First state model](./model_state.py)
* Write a python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base()


### [7. All states via SQLAlchemy](./7-model_state_fetch_all.py)
* Write a script that lists all State objects from the database alx_0e_0_addis


### [8. First state](./8-model_state_fetch_first.py)
* Write a script that prints the first State object from the database alx_0e_0_addis


### [9. Contains `a`](./9-model_state_filter_a.py)
* Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database alx_0e_0_addis


### [10. Get a state](./10-model_state_my_get.py)
* Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database alx_0e_0_addis


### [11. Add a new state](./11-model_state_insert.py)
* Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database alx_0e_0_addis

### [12. Update a state](./12-model_state_update_id_2.py)
* Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database alx_0e_0_addis

### [13. Delete states](./13-model_state_delete_a.py)
* Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database alx_0e_0_addis
